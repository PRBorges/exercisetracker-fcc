# Exercise Tracker

This is the [Exercise Tracker project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/exercise-tracker) required for the FreeCodeCamp Backend certification.

The project was developed from the Javascript [boilerplate repo](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-project-exercisetracker/) from FCC but in Typescript.

The project was submitted to FCC [as a replit](https://replit.com/@PRBorges/ExerciseTracker-FCC). It should be live at [](https://ExerciseTracker-FCC.prborges.repl.co).

## Endpoints:

* / provides a form to submit username, exercise.
* /api/users/:username to post a new user.
* /api/users/:_id/exercises
